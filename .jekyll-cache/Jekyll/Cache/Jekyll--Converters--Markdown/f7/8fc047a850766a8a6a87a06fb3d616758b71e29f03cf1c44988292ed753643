<p>Iâ€™m not gonna to use 2020 as an excuse to stop my growth. I want to indulge myself with like-minded people and be a part of something bigger than myself.</p>

<p class="fs-4 fw-300">Although I may not belong in the generation of the Macintosh, I do belong in the gaming community. I share the sentiment behind the creation of such a software, and I would like to make it better.</p>

<h2 id="scummvm---launching-a-new-documentation-portal">ScummVM - Launching a new documentation portal</h2>

<p>The current state of the user documentation is rather faulty. ScummVMâ€™s audience targets an amateur audience as well as the computer geeks. This makes the user facing docs as the top priority. For this project, simplicity should be a major goal. Documentation should be concise, incisive and to the point. Information is plentiful, but lacks a touch of professionalism. The approach will focus heavily of collecting, restructing, and organising.</p>

<p>The proposal first discusses about the shortcomings of the documentation and how to tackle it. Further, it presents sitemaps,layouts and write-up snippets to provide a sneak-peek to the new documentation portal. The user readability has been given paramount importance by using a friendly, yet informative attitude.</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>ScummVMâ€™s documentation has a variety of issues. Discussed as below:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Readability
    <ul>
      <li>Information is <strong>scattered</strong> and <strong>dissipated</strong> - Information is dispersed among mutltiple sources of documentation. This makes the reader go through a lot of hassle trying to find instructions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Navigation
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Poor documentation structure</strong>. Information is abundant, but lacks a concrete catalogue. What good is the gold that cannot be mined?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Redundancy
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiple instances</strong> exist for the same documentation. This leads to confusion among users and they might feel lost trying to figure whatâ€™s best for them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Highlighting
    <ul>
      <li>ScummVM documentation has a plethora of <strong>amazing functionalities that never make it to the readerâ€™s eyes</strong>. ScummVMâ€™s features require better documenting and showcasing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
