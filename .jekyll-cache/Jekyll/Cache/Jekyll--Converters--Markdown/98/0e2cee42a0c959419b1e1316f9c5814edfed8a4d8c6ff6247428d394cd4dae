<p>The new documentation portal will not carry forward the mistakes previously made. This section will talk about my approach towards making this project a success; The solution has been formulated keeping everything in mind that was discussed on the previous page. The keypoints of the new documentation are summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Collecting and Gathering
    <ul>
      <li>Information will be gathered from the User Manual, Wiki, and README to create the new portal. The guides will be written by <strong>coalescing only the most important bits of information</strong>. The new content would be brief for the beginner user and engaging to the veteran.</li>
      <li><strong>Features will not be seenzoned anymore</strong>. Certain features are of necessity to the user, but are prone to being overlooked. The new documentation portal will showcase all the functionalities of ScummVM.</li>
      <li><strong>No repitions</strong>. All relevant content should be in one spot. A complete compilation of all the resources in one portal. No more dispersion of data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Better support
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Refreshing the manuals</strong>. The current manual is good, but has become outdated. Certain sections of documentation need prime focus, such as: Running options,Configuration. These documents need to be dusted and filtered of the unnecessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Scattered help</strong>. ScummVM has documented certain commonly faced issues, but again, they are all over the place. For instance: FAQs exist on every document portal. They need to be compiled and shown in one spot, preferably with tags.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Brand new layout</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I have compiled the entire sitemap of the new documentation portal. This will highlight all the major changes between the existing user manual and my portal. <strong>Relocation of information is very necessary</strong> and one of the major goals would be to keep resources where they should be.</li>
      <li>Divied section “<em>Using ScummVM</em>” into 2 parts - “<em>ScummVM Running Options” and “_Game Running Options</em>”. This was done to improve readability and acheiving the objective of assembling resources.</li>
      <li>“<em>ScummVM Running Options</em>” focuses on the application and all related functions.</li>
      <li>“<em>Game Running Options</em>” focuses on games, their issues, and related functions.</li>
      <li>Added new sections:
        <ul>
          <li>“<em>Guides</em>”: Features of ScummVM that every beginner to intermediate user would be interested in. (Command line options, Installation guides etc. ). This section gives prime focus towards hands-on knowledge about ScummVM. Users will find it extremely helpful</li>
          <li>“<em>Advanced Guides</em>”: Features of ScummVM that only the experts use. (Compiling binaries, Music and Sound etc.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Removed section “<em>ScummVM Interface</em>”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
