# Using the GUI

The recommended way to use the tools are using the tool GUI, run the program tool program.

Most common usage is to compress files, to do that, simply click Next as compression is the default activity. If you are compressing Touche data files, you need to select advanced mode and then compress_touche, as the tools do not support selecting the touche directory automatically.
