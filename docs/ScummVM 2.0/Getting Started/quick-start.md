# Quick Start  
ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this is that ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the game, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!  

In this Quick Start guide, we will walk through the steps needed to quickly set up the ScummVM and how to run a game on it.  

## Prerequisites  
See [requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/ScummVM 2.0/Getting Started/requirements.md%})
