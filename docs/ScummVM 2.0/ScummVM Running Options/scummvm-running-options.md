# ScummVM Configuration

ScummVM can be launched directly by running the executable. From this point onwards, you can begin configuring ScummVM. Please note that you should refrain running ScummVM from more than one location; Certain functions like _"save files"_ will face issues which we shall discuss in details later on.

ScummVM can be configured using [The Launcher]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/ScummVM 2.0/ScummVM Running Options/launcher.md%}) or using [The Command-Line]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/ScummVM 2.0/ScummVM Running Options/command-line.md%})
