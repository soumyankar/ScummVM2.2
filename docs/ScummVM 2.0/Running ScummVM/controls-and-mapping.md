# Controls

## Personal Computers

These instructions concern any computer that has a keyboard and a mouse (e.g. running Windows, Mac OS, Linux). As for most applications running on computers, you will need the mouse and the keyboard to control ScummVM and the games. When you are in the Launcher you can configure ScummVM and games as well as start games, all with the mouse. When running a game there are a number of hotkeys to which ScummVM will respond (e.g. to save a game, take a snapshot, quit ScummVM).

The games supported by ScummVM are point-and-click games. This means that you need to use the mouse to control them. In some of the games (e.g. the older AGI games) you may also need to use the keyboard to type actions to perform (e.g. "look door"). The exact controls for each game depend on the game. For example, in most LucasArts games you can click on a verb to perform an action or use a shortcut (e.g. press ‘t’ for talk), but the Curse of Monkey Island has a different control system from the other games. Usually you can find the instructions on how to control a specific game in the manual that came with it.
