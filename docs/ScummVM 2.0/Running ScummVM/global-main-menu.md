# Global Main Menu

The Global Menu is a general menu which is available to all of the game engines by pressing Ctrl-F5. From this menu there are the following buttons: Resume, Options, About, Return to Launcher, and Quit. Selecting ```Options``` will display a dialog where basic audio settings, such as volume levels, can be adjusted. Selecting 'Return to Launcher' will close the current game and return the user back to the ScummVM Launcher, where another game may be selected to play.

**Note**: Returning to the Launcher is not supported by all of the engines, and the button will be disabled in the Global Menu if it is not supported.
