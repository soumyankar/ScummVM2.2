# Language Options

ScummVM includes a language option for Maniac Mansion, Zak McKracken, The Dig, The Curse of Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel Sky and Broken Sword.

Note that with the exception of Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword, multilanguage versions of Goblins games and Nippon Safes Inc., using this option does not change the language of the game (which usually is hardcoded), but rather is only used to select the appropriate font (e.g. for a German version of a game, one containing umlauts).

An exception are The Dig and The Curse of Monkey Island -- non-English versions can be set to 'English.' This however only affects subtitles; game speech will remain the same.
