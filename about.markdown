# Ending Notes

I document my thought process on this page. 

- ScummVM Interface is probably irrelevant enough to the beginner user; We are already talking about options multiple times through the portal. Global Main Menu deserves a bit of attention, should have a section on the quick start guide.

- Redundancy can be a good thing sometimes. For instance, save files deserves a spot on "Guides" and also on "Game Options"

- Division of resources is very important and I feel this will be achieved in an incremental process with active feedback from users and developers alike. The original sitemap remains, certain pages would be given a bit of liquidity.

- HOW-TOs: where should I put them? Are they guides? Or should a new section be dedicated for them?

- Compiling from sources: Unsure. Need advice.
	- Integrate wiki page?
	- Listing all libraries; acquiring; installing
	- Include information from ReadME/10.0-Compiling.
	- Make Indiviual pages for installing like I did above?
