    "content": "I document my thought process on this page. | ScummVM Interface is probably irrelevant enough to the beginner user; We are already talking about options multiple times through the portal. Global Main Menu deserves a bit of attention, should have a section on the quick start guide. | Redundancy can be a good thing sometimes. For instance, save files deserves a spot on “Guides” and also on “Game Options” . | Division of resources is very important and I feel this will be achieved in an incremental process with active feedback from users and developers alike. The original sitemap remains, certain pages would be given a bit of liquidity. | HOW-TOs: where should I put them? Are they guides? Or should a new section be dedicated for them? . | Compiling from sources: Unsure. Need advice. | Integrate wiki page? | Listing all libraries; acquiring; installing | Include information from ReadME/10.0-Compiling. | Make Indiviual pages for installing like I did above? | . | HOW-TOs are on the wiki? Should they be integrated? It may be out of scope. | User Manual/Appendix: Tools - Maybe GUI, CLI should make it to the guide? What about the rest, compression tools? extraction tools? | . If you’ve read this far, maybe you’d like to take a look at my poison. ",

    "title": "What are boot params?",
    "content": "A boot param is a special number which allows you (if used appropriately, see below) to go directly to a specific part of a game. These boot params are mostly useful for debugging and playtesting a game; you get teleported to a certain situation in a game, with some of the items appropriate for it. It is not always possible to continue and complete a game from this, because you may lack important items. But for us developers, it’s very helpful, because we can quickly get to trouble spots in a clean state, and try to reproduce any bugs you report to us. These boot params do not exist by chance or magic: they were put into the game data by the original developers of the games, and were meant for exactly the same purpose we use them for: to help in debugging the game. Of course, they also make a nice cheat system (with some caveats, as I tried to outline above). Note: In some SCUMM games, the boot params can produce a room with music and the cursor, but without actual graphics. This was known to happen with the original executables as well. How do I use a boot param? . Pick a game from the list below, and choose a boot param for it. Then, specify it on the command line like this: ./scummvm -d0 -b BOOTPARAM TARGET . Or on MacOS like this: . open /Applications/scummvm.app --args -d0 -b BOOTPARAM TARGET . The TARGET in the above command should typically be the ScummVM ID value of the game you are targeting. This means that you should have already added this game successfully in ScummVM and looked up its specific ID (eg. via the Edit Game dialogue for the specific game entry). Please use the --list-targets command line option first to list available configured and valid targets to use with the boot parameter command. To be a bit more specific: Let’s say you want to get into the hut of the cannibals in Monkey Island 1. Well, the table below tells us that this is boot param 5555, and the target is “monkey”. So, enter this on the command line: ./scummvm -d0 -b 5555 monkey . (By the way, this would also work with monkey, monkeyvga etc.). How did we generate these tables? . Some of these lists are based on the output of ./scummvm -d1 -b1 TARGET; some information is also from this article. These may contain some mistakes. Ultimately we plan to correct these and maybe enhance the descriptions a bit… . I see a lot of question marks in some of the tables, why? . Some of the games contain descriptions for the boot params; some don’t. In the latter case, we have to manually fill in the descriptions. This hasn’t been done in all cases yet, as you can see. Help here is welcome – if you want, feel free to fill in some of the gaps and send us your work, we’ll be happy to integrate it here. ",

Those are marked with an asteriks (*) symbol (except for the cases we overlooked ;-). In addition to the boot params listed below, you can use values greater than 900 to be teleported to specific rooms. To be precise, if you give the number x, then you get sent to room (x-700). Furthermore, in the CD/Mac versions of Monkey (target ‘monkey’, not ‘monkeyvga’ or ‘monkeyega), you can specify a boot param between 3000 and 3777 (including both numbers). It’s currently not documented what those boot params do precisely. Finally, boot params not covered by the list below will be interpreted as raw room numbers and cause the game to start in that room.

If you are compiling for Windows, Linux or Mac OS X, you need SDL-1.2.2 or newer (older versions may work, but are unsupported), and a supported compiler. Several compilers, including GCC, mingw and recent versions of Microsoft Visual C++ are supported. If you wish to use MP3-compressed CD tracks or .SOU files, you will need to install the MAD library; likewise you will need the appropriate libraries for Ogg Vorbis and FLAC compressed sound. For compressed save states, zlib is required. Some parts of ScummVM, particularly scalers, have highly optimized versions written in assembler. If you wish to use this option, you will need to install nasm assembler. Note that we currently only have x86 MMX optimized versions, and they will not compile on other processors.

When you are in the Launcher you can configure ScummVM and games as well as start games, all with the mouse. When running a game there are a number of hotkeys to which ScummVM will respond (e.g. to save a game, take a snapshot, quit ScummVM). The games supported by ScummVM are point-and-click games. This means that you need to use the mouse to control them. In some of the games (e.g. the older AGI games) you may also need to use the keyboard to type actions to perform (e.g. “look door”). The exact controls for each game depend on the game. For example, in most LucasArts games you can click on a verb to perform an action or use a shortcut (e.g. press ‘t’ for talk), but the Curse of Monkey Island has a different control system from the other games. Usually you can find the instructions on how to control a specific game in the manual that came with it. ",

However, there are cases where the game companies (such as LucasArts) themselves bundled ‘cracked’ executables with their games – in these cases the data files still contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter bypasses them (similar to what an illegally cracked version might do, only that here the producer of the game did it). There is no way for us to tell the difference between legitimate and pirated data files, so for the games where we know that a cracked version of the original interpreter was sold at some point, ScummVM will always have to bypass the copy protection. In some cases ScummVM will still show the copy protection screen. Try entering any answer. Chances are that it will work.

    "content": "The Curse of Monkey Island . For this game, you will need the comi.la0, comi.la1 and comi.la2 files. The comi.la0 file can be found on either CD, but since they are identical it doesn’t matter which one of them you use. In addition, you will need a resource subdirectory with all of the files from the resource subdirectories on both CDs. Some of the files appear on both CDs, but again they’re identical. Macintosh Games . All LucasArts SCUMM based adventures except Curse of Monkey Island also exist in versions for the Macintosh. ScummVM can use most (all?) of them, however, in some cases some additional work is required. First off, if you are not using a Macintosh for this, accessing the CD/floppy data might be tricky. See notes in the Accessing HFS filesystems section. Most of the newer games on the Macintosh shipped with only a single data file (note that in some cases this data file was made invisible, so you may need extra tools in order to copy it). ScummVM is able to directly use such a data file; simply point ScummVM at the directory containing it, and it should work (just like with every other supported game). We also provide a tool called 'extract_scumm_mac' in the tools package to extract the data from these data files, but this is neither required nor recommended. Maniac Mansion NES . Supported versions are English GB (E), French (F), German (G), Swedish(SW) and English US (U). ScummVM requires just the PRG section to run and not the whole ROM. In order to get the game working, you will have to strip out the first 16 bytes from the ROM you are trying to work with. Any hex editor will work as long as you are able to copy/paste. After you open the ROM with the hex editor, copy everything from the second row (17th byte) to the end. After you do this, paste it to a new hex file. Name the new file “Maniac Mansion (XX).prg” while XX stands for the version you are working with (E, F, G, SW, or U). The final size should be exactly 262144 bytes. If you add the game manually make sure that the platform is set to NES. Most common mistakes which prevents the game from running: . | Bad file | ROM extracted with the 0.7.0 tools | You try to feed ScummVM with the FULL ROM and not just the PRG section. | . It is also possible to extract the separate LFL files from the PRG section. To do so use the 'extract_mm_nes' utility from the tools package. Maniac Mansion Commodore 64 . This games is detected and runs in ScummVM but is not yet completable. Simply name the D64 disks “maniac1.d64” and “maniac2.d64”, then ScummVM should be able to automatically detect the game if you point it at the right directory. Alternatively, you can use 'extract_mm_c64' from the tools package to extract the data files. But then the game will not be properly auto-detected by ScummVM, and you must make sure that the platform is set to Commodore64. We recommend using the much simpler approach described in the previous paragraph. Zak McKracken Commodore 64 . Rename the D64 disks “zak1.d64” and “zak2.d64”, then ScummVM should be able to automatically detect the game if you point it at the right directory. Alternatively, you can use ‘extract_zak_c64’ from the tools package to extract the data files. But then the game will not be properly auto-detected by ScummVM, and you must make sure that the platform is set to Commodore64. We recommend using the much simpler approach described in the previous paragraph. ",

    "content": "Beneath a Steel Sky . In August 2003, the creators and copyright holders of Beneath a Steel Sky, Revolution Software, released the game as freeware for use with ScummVM. You can therefore download the game from our Downloads page. Then follow the general instructions. Starting with ScummVM 0.8.0 you need the additional ‘SKY.CPT’ file to run Beneath a Steel Sky. This file is distributed with ScummVM on most platforms. You can place it in either the directory containing the other game data files (SKY.DNR, SKY.DSK), in your extrapath, or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides. Broken Sword 1 . For this game, you will need all of the ﬁles from the clusters directories on both CDs. You will also need the speech.clu ﬁles from the speech directories, but since they are not identical you will need to rename them speech1.clu and speech2.clu for CD 1 and 2 respectively. In addition, you will need a music subdirectory with all of the ﬁles from the music subdirectories on both CDs. Some of these ﬁles appear on both CDs, but in these cases they are either identical or, in one case, so nearly identical that it makes little difference. Starting with ScummVM 1.0.0, the original Smacker cutscenes (.smk files) are supported without having to download a video pack from the website. To use them you will need to copy the files from the smackshi directories of both CDs. You can ignore the smackslo directories since they contains lower quality versions of the same cutscenes. Broken Sword 2 . For this game, you will need all of the ﬁles from the clusters directories on both CDs. (Actually, a few of them may not be strictly necessary, but the ones that I’m uncertain about are all fairly small.) You will need to rename the speech.clu and music.clu ﬁles speech1.clu, speech2.clu, music1.clu and music2.clu so that ScummVM can tell which ones are from CD 1 and which ones are from CD 2. Any other ﬁles that appear in both cluster directories are identical. Use whichever you like. In addition, you will need the cd.bin, cd.inf and startup.inf ﬁles from the sword2 directory on CD 1. Starting with ScummVM 1.0.0, the original Smacker cutscenes (.smk files) are supported without having to download a video pack from the website. ",

    "content": "Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 . If you have the dual version of Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2 on CD, you will find the Windows version in the main directory of the CD and the DOS version in the DOS directory of the CD. Both are supported by ScummVM but depending on the version you want to use you will not need to copy the same files (see the game datafiles page for more details). The Feeble Files . The following instructions are valid for the Windows versions of the game. Depending on the version that you have, you will have either two CDs or four CDs. The instructions to use this game with ScummVM are nearly the same for both versions. You will need to copy all the files listed in the game datafiles page in a directory on your hard drive. Some of the files can be copied directly from the CDs and others are packed into an InstallShield Cabinet file (the files with the .cab extension). For the later you will either need to run the installer on Windows (or using Wine or Darwine on Linux and Mac OS X respectively) or to unpack the files using the i5comp decompression tool (unshield has been reported to fail on these files). After running the installer you can copy the files from where they were installed to the directory in which you are copying all the files for ScummVM. During the copy you have to pay special attention to the voices.wav files. There is one on each CD and they are different. Therefore you will have to rename them so that you can copy all of these files in the same directory. Rename voices.wav from CD1 to voices1.wav and voices.wav from CD2 to voices2.wav. If you have the four CDs version you will also need to rename voices.wav from CD 3 and 4 to voices3.wav and voices4.wav respectively. Starting from version 0.13.0 ScummVM can read the original Smacker video files (the files with the .smk extension). If you are using an older version of ScummVM you will need to re-encode the video files using the RAD Video Tools and the 'encode_dxa' tool (or 'convert_dxa.bat' batch file). ",

In March 2004, the creators and copyright holders of Flight of the Amazon Queen, John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis, released the game as freeware for use with ScummVM. You can therefore download the game from our Downloads page. Then follow the general instructions. If you have the original CD of the game game and would like to play this version, you will also need the ‘queen.tbl’ file. This file is distributed with ScummVM on most platforms. You can place it in either the directory containing the ‘queen.1’ file, in your extrapath, or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides. Alternatively you can use the 'compress_queen' tool from the tools package to ‘rebuild’ your FOTAQ data file to include the table for that specific version, and thus removing the run-time dependency on the ‘queen.tbl’ file. This tool also allows you to compress the speech and sound effects with MP3, OGG or FLAC. The Legend of Kyrandia . To run The Legend of Kyrandia under ScummVM you need the ‘kyra.dat’ file. This file is distributed with ScummVM on most platforms. You can place it in either the directory containing the other game data files, in your extrapath, or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides. Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back . In August 2008, the creators and copyright holders of Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back, Alcachofa Soft, released the game as freeware for use with ScummVM. It is available for download from our Downloads page. | You will need to download the English version (even if you want to play it in another language). You will also need the ‘DRASCULA.DAT’ file. This file is distributed with ScummVM on most platforms. You can place it in either the directory containing the ‘PACKET.001’ game data file, in your extrapath, or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides. | Then if you want to play the game in another language (Spanish, German, French or Italian) you will also need to download the international pack and put the files together with the English version file (i.e. have all the PACKET.00# and DRASCULA.DAT files in the same directory). | Finally to play the game with a music score you will need to download the Music Add-on and put the ogg files together with the other game files. | Then follow the general instructions to add the game in ScummVM. If you have installed the international pack, it will ask you in which language you want to play the game when adding it in ScummVM. You can add the game several times with a different language if you want to. The English and Spanish versions both have voice over in that language. The other versions will use English voice over with subtitles in the language you selected. | . Note: in the Music add-on the ogg files are in an audio directory, if you keep them in that directory you will need to add it in the Game extra path. To do so, after adding the game in ScummVM, select the game in the ScummVM launcher and click on Edit Game. Then go to the Paths tab and in Extra Path add the path to the Music directory in which all the ogg files should be. Alternatively you can move all the ogg files in the same directory where you have the data files (the PACKET.00# files), and it will pick up the music without having to select an extra path. Fascination . In order to get the game working, you will have to extract the STK files hidden on the CD. In order to do so, create an ISO of the first (data) track on your original disc (~11M, not 652M), then use the 'extract_fascination_cd' utility from the tools package to create the four STK files and copy those files to the game directory. The game also uses the following audio track containing the speech. Extract it and compress it as per other games with CD-DA audio, then copy it to the game directory (named as track1.mp3). Blade Runner . You need to create a game directory and copy the required data files in there from the four CDs. | Note that you may copy the CDFRAMES.DAT files from the CDs into the game directory, renaming the files from the first, second, third and fourth CD to CDFRAMES1.DAT, CDFRAMES2.DAT, CDFRAMES3.DAT and CDFRAMES4.DAT respectively. | Alternatively, you may use the ‘pack_bladerunner’ utility from the tools package to create a single HDFRAMES.DAT file from the partial CDFRAMES.DAT files located on the four CDs; this newly created HDFRAMES.DAT file should then be copied in the game directory. | . Please make sure that, when you add your Blade Runner game directory to ScummVM, the Save Path folder is a folder for which you have write permission, so that auto-saves and manually saved games work properly. For subtitles support, you may download the SUBTITLES.MIX file provided by ScummVM and put it in the game directory. Currently, the provided file will work with the all available and supported localized versions of the game but will only show English subtitles in all but the French version, which will show French subtitles. However, other localized versions of the subtitles (and the game’s user interface) may also be supported in the future. ScummVM offers a semi-automated process to pack a localized transcript from an Excel file (of appropriate structure) into a SUBTITLES.MIX file. This process, along with usage instructions for the ScummVM developer tools involved, is described in detail on a ScummVM GitHub page. ",

For some games the files are packed and not directly accessible on the floppy or CD. In such a case you will need to run the original game installer and then copy the files from where they have been installed to the directory in which you want to install the game to play with ScummVM. For DOS games you can try to use DosBox to run the installer. For Windows games if you don’t have Windows you can try Wine (or Darwine on Mac OS X). Also some games (e.g. multi-CD games) need a bit more work to be installed. See the General Notes and Games Specific instructions below. Once the game files are on the hard drive, start ScummVM, click on Add Game (see also Adding a game) and then you are ready to play. ",

    "doc": "General Instructions",
    "title": "General Notes",
    "content": "Case sensitivity . Most instructions are written for the PC versions (which in some case is the only version) of the games. Windows and DOS use case-insensitive ﬁle systems, so if one CD has a ﬁle called MONKEY.DAT and another has a ﬁle called monkey.dat, they are the same ﬁles. These instructions give ﬁle names in all lower-case names, even if that’s not always how they appear on the CDs. In fact, on case-sensitive ﬁle systems you will have to make sure that all ﬁlenames use either all upper- or all lower-case letters for ScummVM to be able to ﬁnd the ﬁles. Multi-CD Games . In general, ScummVM does not deal very well with multi-CD games. This is because ScummVM assumes everything about a game can be found in one directory. Even if ScummVM does make some provisions for asking the user to change CD, the original games usually install a small number of ﬁles to hard disk. Unless these ﬁles can be found on all the CDs, ScummVM will be in trouble. Fortunately, ScummVM has no problems running the games entirely from hard disk, if you create a directory with the correct combination of ﬁles. Usually, when a ﬁle appears on more than one CD you can pick either of them. Macintosh games: Accessing HFS Filesystems . You will need the “Windows Installer” from the download page. To copy the game data file from the CD to your hard disc, you will need HFVExplorer. Make sure you get the “HFV Explorer installer” rather than the zip file. When you choose to download the zip file, make sure you read the readme included with HFVExplorer, to set it up properly. Run the HFVExplorer installer and allow it to use its defaults. Alternatively you can also use the more recent HFSExplorer. Start up HFVExplorer; if you don’t have a shortcut for it, find it in “C:\\Program Files\\HFVExplorer”. It should open the HFS (Macintosh filesystem) CD-ROM automatically when you insert the disc. Make sure HFVExplorer is displaying hidden files: Select View-&gt;Options and enable “Show invisible Mac files” on the “File attributes” tab. Now, look for the data file in the right pane. It will probably end with the word “Data” and will be the largest file on the volume. For instance (using Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road as an example), it is called “Sam &amp; Max Data” on the “Sam &amp; Max” CD-ROM. Select the data file and copy it (use Ctrl+C or Edit-&gt;Copy). In the left HFVExplorer pane, navigate to the directory where you want the game to reside on your hard disc. We recommend selecting drive C: and creating a new folder called “SamNMax” or a name that better reflects your particular game. Paste the data file (with Ctrl+V or Edit-&gt;Paste) and allow HFVExplorer to choose the copy mode. Now, wait while the program copies several hundred megabytes from the CD. When the file is copied, close HFVExplorer. Datafiles . For a comprehensive list of required Datafiles for supported games visit: Here. Extra Datafiles . Some games require additional files that are not part of the original data. Those files can generally be found in our Downloads page. Games that require additional data: . | Beneath a Steel Sky (sky.cpt) | Flight of the Amazon Queen | Kyrandia Series (kyra.dat) | Lands of Lore Series (kyra.dat) | Lure of the Temptress (lure.dat) | Versailles 1685 (cryomni3d.dat) | . The most up to date list of Engine data files can be found in our source code repository . ",

These filters take the original game graphics, and scale it by a certain fixed factor (usually 2x or 3x) before displaying them to you. So for example, if the game originally ran at a resolution of 320x200 (typical for most of the SCUMM games), then using a filter with a scale factor of 2x will effectively yield 640x400 graphics. Likewise a 3x filter will give 960x600. ScummVM uses the following graphic filters: . | The different scale factors and what they do. | Command line option. | Notes. | . ",

    "content": "ScummVM possesses a treasure trove of information that awaits unlocking. The current state of documentation is comparable to a jigsaw puzzle - broken pieces and a fragmented picture. ScummVM’s audience comprises of amateur users as well as computer geeks, and hence simplicity should be the primary goal for this project. Documentation should be concise, incisive and to the point. Information is plentiful but lacks a touch of professionalism. The approach will focus heavily on collecting, reconstructing, and organizing. The proposal first discusses the shortcomings of the documentation and how to tackle it. Further, it presents sitemaps, layouts, and write-up snippets to provide a sneak-peek to the new documentation portal. The user readability has been given paramount importance by using a friendly, yet informative attitude. Analysis . ScummVM’s documentation has a variety of issues. Discussed as below: . | Readability . | Information is scattered and dissipated - Information is dispersed among multiple sources of documentation. This makes the reader go through a lot of hassle trying to find instructions. | . | Navigation . | Poor documentation structure. Information is abundant but lacks a concrete catalog. What good is the gold that cannot be mined? | . | Redundancy . | Multiple instances exist for the same documentation. This leads to confusion among users, and they might feel lost trying to figure what’s best for them. | . | Highlighting . | ScummVM documentation has a plethora of amazing functionalities that never make it to the reader’s eyes. ScummVM’s features require better documenting and showcasing. | . | Consolidating of ReadME . | The content on the ReadME is disoriented. Topics on the ReadME needs to be categorized roughly into documentation(Usage, Guides etc.) and notes(Supported Games, Bugs etc). | . | . | Read Solution | . ",

    "content": ". The Launcher . This is the ScummVM main window, otherwise called “Launcher”. You get to the Launcher whenever you start ScummVM without using command-line parameters to launch a game directly. The big area on the left lists the games you have added to ScummVM. Besides showing the titles of those games, this list usually offers some additional information about each game, such as original platform, language, etc. You can highlight any game on the list by typing the first letter(s) of its title, or by simply clicking on it. To the right of the list you can see a number of buttons. In brief, their functions are: . | Start - launches the highlighted game | Load Game - allows you to load a previously saved state for the highlighted game (if supported) | Add Game - allows you to add a game to the list; when you press Shift, the Add Game button turns into Mass Add, which can be used to add several games in one go | Edit Game - allows you to configure the highlighted game, overriding the global options | Remove Game - removes the highlighted game from the list | Options - allows you to configure global game settings, as well as a number of ScummVM options | About - shows credits and miscellaneous information about your version of ScummVM | Quit - closes the Launcher (quits the ScummVM application) | . Just above the list of games, next to a magnifying glass icon, you can see a small input box. This is Quick Search - it allows you to filter your list of added games by a desired expression. For instance, you can type “Monkey Island” to quickly locate all “Monkey Island” games on the list, or you can type “German” if you wish to play a game in German - the uses are countless. There is no need for you to press anything to apply the filter you have typed: it is applied automatically on the fly. Also the filter is not case sensitive which means if you type “demo” it will display both the items that contain “demo” and those that contain “Demo”. If you want to clear the filter and see the full list of your games, just press the “C” button next to the input box . Load Game . This menu allows you to run the highlighted game from a previously saved state straight from the Launcher, without having to start the game first. Here you can usually see the names of your savegames, their timestamps and screenshots to aid you in finding the exact state. When you have located the desired saved game, just select it and press Load to launch the game using that state. Besides loading a previous state, you can also delete obsolete saved games by highlighting them and clicking Delete. Note that there are games that do not support this feature altogether, or whose saved states lack some information (e.g. playtime, screenshots). Options . This menu allows you to define default game options, as well as change a number of the ScummVM Launcher’s settings. For more details on how to fine-tune ScummVM and pre-configure games, see “Configuring ScummVM”. Edit Game . You see this game configuration window whenever you add a game to the Launcher or click on Edit Game button. Here you can configure a game individually by overriding the default game settings you have set in the Launcher’s Options, as well as change the game’s language and original platform (if applicable). For more information, see “Configuring a Game in ScummVM” . Global Main Menu . The Global Menu (or GMM for Global Main Menu) is a feature that premiered in ScummVM 0.13.0. It is available in all games by pressing Crtl-F5 and provides the following features: . | Resume: close the GMM and resume the game. | Load: load a game state (this is not available in all games). | Save: save a game state (this is not available in all games). | Options: change some options to play the game (e.g. music volume, subtitles speed). | About: display the ScummVM About box (also available from the The Launcher). | Help: displays a list of key commands (not available in all engines) | Return to Launcher: quit the game and return to The Launcher (not available in all engines) | Quit: quit the game and ScummVM and return to the Operating System. | . In some games you can still access the original menu by using Alt-F5. You can save and load games using this, however it is not intended for this purpose, and may even crash ScummVM in some games. Global Main Menu . The Global Menu is a general menu which is available to all of the game engines by pressing Ctrl-F5. From this menu there are the following buttons: Resume, Options, About, Return to Launcher, and Quit. Selecting Options will display a dialog where basic audio settings, such as volume levels, can be adjusted. Selecting ‘Return to Launcher’ will close the current game and return the user back to the ScummVM Launcher, where another game may be selected to play. Note: Returning to the Launcher is not supported by all of the engines, and the button will be disabled in the Global Menu if it is not supported.

    "title": "Launcher Configuration",
    "content": "The ScummVM Launcher gives us a graphical method for changing the settings that it uses to run games. There are two ways to do this: firstly by changing the default settings (which games will follow unless told otherwise), secondly by configuring an individual game to use settings that are different from the defaults. To begin with we will look at changing the default settings. To do this, click on the “Options” button on the right-hand side of the Launcher window. There are many options, and they are separated into tabs: we shall look at each tab in turn. Graphics Tab . The graphics tab allows us to change various things about the way the games are displayed on screen when played. | Control | Description | . | Graphics Mode | This allows us to change the graphic filter that ScummVM uses (e.g. to scale the game to a bigger resolution). The option has no effect on games whose original resolution is higher than 320x200 or 320x240 (e.g. 640x480) - such games should be configured separately. See the Graphic filters section of the manual for more detail | . | Render Mode | This allows us to change the render mode that ScummVM uses. See the Render Modes section of the manual for more detail | . | Aspect Ratio correction | Most games supported by ScummVM were designed to be played at a screen resolution of 320x200 using rectangular pixels (higher than they were wide). Most modern systems however are using square pixels, which means that the image appears to be squeezed vertically and the characters look wider and shorter than they should. If this option is checked, ScummVM corrects for this by stretching the game window to a resolution of 320x240 which with square pixels looks the same as 320x200 on old monitors. As with Graphic filters, this takes a little processing power to achieve. We can combine this with a Graphic filter, and for example with a scaling of x2 the window size will be 640x480 instead of 640x400. | . | Fullscreen mode | Switches between playing games in a window, or playing them in fullscreen mode. Switch between the two using Alt-Enter while in a game. | . Audio Tab . The audio tab in the options allows us to change various things about the way that sound is outputted in ScummVM games. | Control | Description | . | Music Driver | This is the method that ScummVM uses to output MIDI music. For more details, see the section on music drivers. | . | AdLib Emulator | This is the emulator used by ScummVM to generate the music when the AdLib music driver is selected. Two emulators are currently available. MAME OPL emulator was the emulator that was used up to version 0.13.1. More recently the DOSBox OPL emulator has been added (but is still experimental). | . | Output Rate | This is the sample rate at which ScummVM plays back sounds (including music if using an emulation music driver, such as the AdLib music driver). For more information, see the Output sample rate section | . | Subtitle Speed | This allows the user to adjust the length of time that the subtitles are displayed on screen: the lower the speed is set, the longer the subtitles appear for. | . Volume Tab . The volume tab allows us to set the relative volumes for the various different types of sound that ScummVM plays. | Control | Description | . | Music Voume | The volume of the music played back in games. This is usually MIDI music played back with one of the music drivers, but some games use digitized music. | . | SFX Volume | The volume of the sound effects within the games. | . | Speech Volume | The volume of the digitized speech in the game, if it has any. | . | Mute All | Mute all sounds. | . MIDI Tab . The MIDI tab lets us change various settings about the MIDI music played back in games. | Control | Description | . | Soundfont | Some music drivers require you to provide them with a Soundfont, which contains samples of instruments for the device to play back. This setting allows you to choose one. | . | Mixed AdLib/MIDI mode | Some games contain sound effects that are exclusive to the AdLib soundtrack. For these games, you may wish to use this mode in order to combine MIDI music with AdLib sound effects. | . | True Roland MT-32 (disable GM emulation) | ScummVM will treat your device as a real MT-32. Because the instrument mappings and system exclusive commands of the MT-32 vary from those of General MIDI devices, you should only enable this option if you are using an actual Roland MT-32, LAPC-I, CM-64, CM-32L, CM-500, or GS device with an MT-32 map. | . | Enable Roland GS Mode | ScummVM will initialize your GS-compatible device with settings that mimic the MT-32’s reverb, (lack of) chorus, pitch bend sensitivity, etc. If it is specified in conjunction with True Roland MT-32 (above), ScummVM will select the MT-32-compatible map and drumset on your GS device. This setting works better than default GM or GS emulation with games that do not have custom instrument mappings (Loom and The Secret of Monkey Island). You should only specify both settings if you are using a GS device that has an MT-32 map, e.g. SC-55, SC-88, SC-8820, etc. Please note that Roland GS Mode is automatically disabled in both Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road, since they use General MIDI natively. If neither of the above settings is enabled, ScummVM will initialize your device in General MIDI mode and use GM emulation in games with MT-32 soundtracks. | . | MIDI gain | The relative volume of the general MIDI music. This is only supported by some of the music drivers. | . Paths Tab . This part of the options lets the user tell ScummVM where to look for particular files. | Control | Description | . | Save Path | This is the default folder in which ScummVM will store saved games. If this is not set, saved games will generally be stored in the current directory. Exceptions to this include: | . | Speech Volume | The volume of the digitized speech in the game, if it has any. | . | Mute All | Mute all sounds. | . Misc Tab . The Misc tab contains options that don’t belong on any of the other tabs . | Control | Description | . | Theme | Click on this button to change the visual appearance of the ScummVM Launcher | . | GUI Renderer | This settings defines how the ScummVM GUI is rendered. The two options are to use either the normal renderer or an antialiased renderer. | . | Autosave | In some games (namely Beneath a Steel Sky, Flight of the Amazon Queen and all SCUMM games), ScummVM will automatically save the game every few minutes. For the SCUMM engine, it will save in Slot 0. This saved game can be loaded again using Ctrl-0 or the F5 menu. Use this control to adjust the time period that ScummVM waits between saves; the default setting is 5 minutes. | . Custom game options that can be toggled via the GUI . A lot of the custom game options in the previous section can be toggled via the GUI. If a custom option is available for a specific game, a new tab called “Engine” will appear when adding or editing the configuration of that game. If the custom options are not shown, the games in question will need to be run once or readded in the ScummVM launcher’s game list. This will update the configuration of each entry, allowing the custom options to be shown. Engine Tab . A lot of the custom game options in the previous section can be toggled via the GUI. If a custom option is available for a specific game, a new tab called “Engine” will appear when adding or editing the configuration of that game. If the custom options are not shown, the games in question will need to be run once or readded in the ScummVM launcher’s game list. This will update the configuration of each entry, allowing the custom options to be shown. Read the next section to read about command-line options. ",

    "content": "f your soundcard driver supports a sequencer, you may set the environment variable SCUMMVM_MIDI to your sequencer device – for example, to /dev/sequencer . If you have problems with not hearing audio in this configuration, you may need to set the environment variable SCUMMVM_MIDIPORT to 1 or 2. This selects the port on the selected sequencer to use. Then start scummvm with the -eseq parameter. This should work on several cards, and may offer better performance and quality than AdLib emulation. However, for those systems where sequencer support does not work, you can always fall back on AdLib emulation. ",

    "content": "If you have installed the ALSA driver with sequencer support, then you may set the environment variable SCUMMVM_PORT or the config file variable alsa_port to specify your sequencer port. If neither is set, the default behavior is to try both “65:0” and “17:0”. Here is a brief guide on how to use the ALSA sequencer with your soundcard. In all cases, to obtain a list of all the sequencer ports you have, try the command aconnect -o -l. This should give output similar to: . client 14: 'Midi Through' [type=kernel] 0 'Midi Through Port-0' client 16: 'SBLive! Value [CT4832]' [type=kernel] 0 'EMU10K1 MPU-401 (UART)' client 17: 'Emu10k1 WaveTable' [type=kernel] 0 'Emu10k1 Port 0 ' 1 'Emu10k1 Port 1 ' 2 'Emu10k1 Port 2 ' 3 'Emu10k1 Port 3 ' client 128: 'TiMidity' [type=user] 0 'TiMidity port 0 ' 1 'TiMidity port 1 ' 2 'TiMidity port 2 ' 3 'TiMidity port 3 ' . The most important bit here is that there are four WaveTable MIDI outputs located at 17:0, 17:1, 17:2 and 17:3, and four TiMidity ports located at 128:0, 128:1, 128:2 and 128:3. If you have a FM-chip on your card, like the SB16, then you have to load the SoundFonts using the sbiload software. Example: . sbiload -p 17:0 /etc/std.o3 /etc/drums.o3 . If you have a WaveTable capable sound card, you have to load a sbk or sf2 SoundFont using the sfxload or asfxload software. Example: . sfxload /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2 . If you don’t have a MIDI capable soundcard, there are two options: FluidSynth and TiMidity. We recommend FluidSynth, as on many systems TiMidity will ‘lag’ behind music. This is very noticeable in iMUSE-enabled games, which use fast and dynamic music transitions. Running TiMidity as root will allow it to setup real time priority, which may reduce music lag. Asking TiMidity to become an ALSA sequencer: . timidity -iAqqq -B2,8 -Os1S -s 44100 &amp; . (If you get distorted output with this setting, you can try dropping the -B2,8 or changing the value.) . Asking FluidSynth to become an ALSA sequencer (using SoundFonts): . fluidsynth -m alsa_seq /path/to/8mbgmsfx.sf2 . Once either TiMidity or FluidSynth are running, use the ‘aconnect -o -l’ command as described earlier in this section. ",

    "title": "Using compressed audio files",
    "content": "Using MP3 files for CD audio . Use LAME or some other MP3 encoder to rip the cd audio tracks to files. Name the files track1.mp3 track2.mp3 etc. ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support to use this option. You will need to rip the file from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the MP3 files in constant bit rate. This can be done with the following LAME command line: . lame -t -q 0 -b 96 track1.wav track1.mp3 . Using Ogg Vorbis files for CD audio . Use oggenc or some other vorbis encoder to encode the audio tracks to files. Name the files track1.ogg track2.ogg etc. ScummVM must be compiled with vorbis support to use this option. You will need to rip the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the vorbis files. This can be done with the following oggenc command line with the value after q specifying the desired quality from 0 to 10: . oggenc -q 5 track1.wav . Using Flac files for CD audio . Use flac or some other flac encoder to encode the audio tracks to files. Name the files track1.flac track2.flac etc. If your filesystem only allows three letter extensions, name the files track1.fla track2.fla etc. ScummVM must be compiled with flac support to use this option. You will need to rip the files from the CD as a WAV file, then encode the flac files. This can be done with the following flac command line: . flac --best track1.wav . Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder options will only affect the encoding time and resulting filesize. Compressing MONSTER.SOU with MP3 . You need LAME, and our compress_scumm_sou utility from the scummvm-tools package to perform this task, and ScummVM must be compiled with MAD support. compress_scumm_sou monster.sou . Eventually you will have a much smaller monster.so3 file, copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the monster.sou file. Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Ogg Vorbis . As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with OGG support. Run: . compress_scumm_sou --vorbis monster.sou . This should produce a smaller monster.sog file, which you should copy to your game directory. Ogg encoding may take a considerable longer amount of time than MP3, so have a good book handy. Compressing MONSTER.SOU with Flac . As above, but ScummVM must be compiled with Flac support. Run: . compress_scumm_sou --flac monster.sou . This should produce a smaller monster.sof file, which you should copy to your game directory. Remember that the quality is always the same, varying encoder options will only affect the encoding time and resulting file size. Playing with the blocksize (-b ), has the biggest impact on the resulting file size -- 1152 seems to be a good value for those kind of soundfiles. Be sure to read the encoder documentation before you use other values. Compressing music/sfx/speech in AGOS games . Use our compress_agos utility from the scummvm-tools package to perform this task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but note that you can only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the respective decoder support enabled. compress_agos effects (For Acorn CD version of Simon 1) compress_agos simon (For Acorn CD version of Simon 1) compress_agos effects.voc (For DOS CD version of Simon 1) compress_agos simon.voc (For DOS CD version of Simon 1) compress_agos simon.wav (For Windows CD version of Simon 1) compress_agos simon2.voc (For DOS CD version of Simon 2) compress_agos simon2.wav (For Windows CD version of Simon 2) compress_agos mac (For Macintosh version of Simon 2) compress_agos voices1.wav (For Windows 2CD/4CD version of Feeble) compress_agos voices2.wav (For Windows 2CD/4CD version of Feeble) compress_agos voices3.wav (For Windows 4CD version of Feeble) compress_agos voices4.wav (For Windows 4CD version of Feeble) compress_agos Music (For Windows version of Puzzle Pack) . For Ogg Vorbis add --vorbis to the options, i.e. compress_agos --vorbis . For Flac add --flac and optional parameters, i.e. compress_agos --flac . Eventually you will have a much smaller *.mp3, *.ogg or *.fla file, copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the old file. Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword . The compress_sword1 tool from the scummvm-tools package can encode music and speech to MP3, Ogg Vorbis as well as Flac. The easiest way to encode the files is simply copying the executable into your BS1 directory (together with the lame encoder) and run it from there. This way, it will automatically encode everything to MP3. Afterwards, you can manually remove the SPEECH?.CLU files and the wave music files. Running compress_sword1 --vorbis will compress the files using Ogg Vorbis instead of MP3. Running compress_sword1 --flac will compress the files using Flac instead of MP3. Use compress_sword1 --help to get a full list of the options. Compressing speech/music in Broken Sword II . Use our compress_sword2 utility from the scummvm-tools package to perform this task. You can choose between multiple target formats, but note that you can only use each if ScummVM was compiled with the respective decoder support enabled. compress_sword2 speech1.clu compress_sword2 music1.clu . For Ogg Vorbis add –vorbis to the options, i.e. compress_sword2 --vorbis . Eventually you will have a much smaller *.cl3 or *.clg file, copy this file to your game directory. You can safely remove the old file. It is possible to use Flac compression by adding the --flac option. However, the resulting *.clf file will actually be larger than the original. Please note that compress_sword2 will only work with the four speech/music files in Broken Sword II. It will not work with any of the other *.clu files, nor will it work with the speech files from Broken Sword. Output sample rate . The output sample rate tells ScummVM how many sound samples to play per channel per second. There is much that could be said on this subject, but most of it would be irrelevant here. The short version is that for most games 22050 Hz is fine, but in some cases 44100 Hz is preferable. On extremely low-end systems you may want to use 11025 Hz, but it is unlikely that you have to worry about that. To elaborate, most of the sounds ScummVM has to play were sampled at either 22050 Hz or 11025 Hz. Using a higher sample rate will not magically improve the quality of these sounds. Hence, 22050 Hz is fine. Some games use CD audio. If you use compressed files for this, they are probably sampled at 44100 Hz, so for these games that may be a better choice of sample rate. When using the AdLib, FM Towns, PC Speaker or IBM PCjr music drivers, ScummVM is responsible for generating the samples. Usually 22050 Hz will be plenty for these, but there is at least one piece of AdLib music in Beneath a Steel Sky that will sound a lot better at 44100 Hz. Using frequencies in between is not recommended. For one thing, your sound card may not support it. In theory, ScummVM should fall back on a sensible frequency in that case, but don’t count on it. More importantly, ScummVM has to resample all sounds to its output frequency. This is much easier to do well if the output frequency is a multiple of the original frequency. ",

(TODO, missing info.) . How to make game icons . On screenshots page you may see the set of nice ‘headshots’ used for the games. If you are submitting screenshots for a new game, you may help with creating the icon too. Don’ts: . 1. Use an image that has been scaled up with a filter 1. Avoid scaling down unless absolutely necessary, if you do scale down, always scale proportionally and try both Nearest Neighbor or Lancoze to see what looks better 1. Keep shadows. Shadows will be done dynamically in CSS. Dos: . 1. Start with our icon template to frame your icon. The image should be centered on the white dot and never flow outside the black rectangle. 1. Be creative 1. Pick a distinguishable image from the game or series. Either a sprite of the main character, a portrait, or a recognizable item/icon from the game 1. Scale up as needed. Only scale up in 2x increments using Nearest Neighbor to preserve pixel art 1. Have sprites and portraits face to the right 1. Erase necessary pixels around the object . How to submit screenshots . | If you have write access to our web source repository, you can commit it directly to the relevant directory. | Alternatively, you can submit it via our bug tracker. | There is a restriction on 250kb per file. There are 2 options you can do: . | Submit several files (you may add them one by one) | Upload somewhere in one archive and provide link in the bugreport | . | . | If you didn’t perform some actions with the screenshot file, for example if you didn’t compress it or were unable to produce thumbnails, please mark your submission accordingly. | Save the result as PNG | .

The guides will be written by coalescing only the essential bits of information. The new content would be brief for the beginner user and engaging to the veteran. | Features will not be seen zoned anymore. Certain features are of necessity to the user but are prone to be overlooked. The new documentation portal will showcase all the functionalities of ScummVM. | No repetitions. All relevant content should be in one spot. A complete compilation of all the resources in one portal. No more dispersion of data. | Improved flow of information. Information has been re-written after collecting. Consistency has been maintained to reflect a feel of a course. | . | Better support . | Refreshing the manuals. The current manual is good but has become outdated. Individual sections of documentation need prime focus, such as: Running options, Configuration. These documents need to be dusted and filtered off of the unnecessary. | Scattered help. ScummVM has documented specific commonly faced issues, but again, they are all over the place. For instance: FAQs exist on every document portal. They need to be compiled and shown in one spot, preferably with tags. | . | Hierarchy improvement . | Facilitating the information. Certain sections of the documentation lack proper arrangment. For instance: command-line options. It should be divided into groups; General, configuration, save-files, music etc. I have tried to present an example here | Step-by-step approach. Information should be supplied in a layered, top-down approach. The existing documentation has been broken down and divided into groups for a better outlook. | . | Brand new layout . | I have compiled the entire sitemap of the new documentation portal. This will highlight all the significant changes between the existing user manual and my portal. Relocation of information is vital and one of the primary goals would be to keep resources where they should be. | Divided section “Using ScummVM” into 2 parts - “ScummVM Running Options” and “_Game Running Options”.

    "content": "(Screenshots wont load) The recommended way to use the tools are using the tool GUI, run the program tool program. Most common usage is to compress files, to do that, simply click Next as compression is the default activity. If you are compressing Touche data files, you need to select advanced mode and then compress_touche, as the tools do not support selecting the touche directory automatically. Next select the input file, depending on the tool you are using, this file to be selected differs greatly. You can look in the list below for the expected extension or filename, if you don’t know it already. For some games this is obvious as there only is a single data file. For games that ship on multiple disks, select the first disk on this page, you will be asked for the second disk on the next page. Sometime a tool is applied on a single file, but the game may contain many such file. By selecting Run on all files with the same extension you can automatically run the tool on all the files with the same extension and present in the same directory as the selected input file. For example you can run compress_scumm_san on all the SAN file of a game. In most cases, the tool to be used will be automatically detected, if there are multiple options, you must manually select the correct tool to be used, this is usually obvious from the name of the tool, if you are unsure, check the list of tools below. In this case, the correct tool (compress_queen) was automatically detected. Now select the output directory, note that the directory must exist. Extraction tools usually generate a large amount of output files, while compression tools generate a single archive. Since ScummVM usually expects a specific filename for compressed archives, you should not change the default after extraction completes. Next, you will be asked for target platform. This is the platform that you are running ScummVM on, not the platform you are running the tools on. Note that this does not make the output files incompatible with other platforms. Instead it affects the default audio settings to be optimized for the platform selected, as support for some are very poor on certain platform (and will make ScummVM run very slow). Next page asks audio for audio format to use, in most cases you can leave this at the default setting. If you want to configure bitrate and quality settings manually, check the advanced options checkbox, and you can change this at the next page. After this, the tool will run. This can take a while and if all went well, you can continue on to the next page. If an error occured, you can go back to adjust settings. Take special care to note that some input files can cause the entire application to crash as many tools don’t check too well for mal-formatted input files. If all is well, advance to the next page to finish the guide! Enjoy your newly compressed/extracted data files! . ",

    "content": ". Peek into the future . No words acts . This portal portrays what was proposed. Feel free to browse through the site, and understand the skeleton of the new documentation. Certain pages consist of write-up snippets. This portal attempted to capture the essence of ScummVM and present it to the user. The pages lack content, but not spirit. Breakdown of proposed portal . | Quick Start: Contains all information for kick-starting ScummVM. Holds instructions for Prerequisties, Installation and Interface. | ScummVM Configuration: Launcher configuration, Command-Line,Config file, and advanced settings for Music, Graphics and Render Modes. | Game Configuration: Custom settings for games. | Controls &amp; Language: Features of ScummVM that facilitate the user experience. | Installing Games: Since ScummVM has a vast arena of users using various ports, I believe devoting an entire section to game installation is important. There is a lot of granular information about games and ports that a user would need to know before they are able to install games.] | Supported Games: Consolidation of ReadME into the portal. | Guides: Probably the most important aspect missing in the current documentation. Users need some information handy when using ScummVM. This section will provide quick hands-on information on topics that are frequently used and also deserve more attention. | Game Notes: Consolidation of ReadME into the portal. | Troubleshooting: Issues that the user will come across. This section will hold solutions to known problems. | Getting Help: To keep track of issues and bugs, changelogs and related content. | . Timeline . The project timeline will proceed as follows: . | Week | Main Task | . | Week 0 | Refining proposal ideas | . | Week 1 | Portal setup &amp; lay groundwork for User Manual | . | Week 2 | User Manual - Quick Start guide | . | Week 3 | User Manual - ScummVM Configuration section | . | Week 4 | User Manual - Game Configuration section and Controls | . | Week 5 | User Manual - Installing Games &amp; Supported Games | . | Week 6 | User Manual - Guides | . | Week 7 | User Manual - Game Notes | . | Week 8 | User Manual - Troubleshooting | . | Week 9 | User Manual - Getting Help | . | Week 10 | Finishing touches and any outstanding work | . | Week 11 | Project summary and submission | .
