For instance, save files deserves a spot on “Guides” and also on “Game Options” . | Division of resources is very important and I feel this will be achieved in an incremental process with active feedback from users and developers alike. The original sitemap remains, certain pages would be given a bit of liquidity. | HOW-TOs: where should I put them? Are they guides?

ScummVM’s audience comprises of amateur users as well as computer geeks, and hence simplicity should be the primary goal for this project. Documentation should be concise, incisive and to the point. Information is plentiful but lacks a touch of professionalism. The approach will focus heavily on collecting, reconstructing, and organizing. The proposal first discusses the shortcomings of the documentation and how to tackle it. Further, it presents sitemaps, layouts, and write-up snippets to provide a sneak-peek to the new documentation portal. The user readability has been given paramount importance by using a friendly, yet informative attitude. Analysis . ScummVM’s documentation has a variety of issues. Discussed as below: . | Readability . | Information is scattered and dissipated - Information is dispersed among multiple sources of documentation. This makes the reader go through a lot of hassle trying to find instructions. | . | Navigation . | Poor documentation structure. Information is abundant but lacks a concrete catalog. What good is the gold that cannot be mined? | . | Redundancy . | Multiple instances exist for the same documentation. This leads to confusion among users, and they might feel lost trying to figure what’s best for them. | . | Highlighting . | ScummVM documentation has a plethora of amazing functionalities that never make it to the reader’s eyes.

This section will talk about my approach towards making this project a success; The solution has been formulated keeping everything in mind that was discussed on the previous page. The key points of the new documentation are summarized as follows: . | Collecting and Gathering . | Information will be gathered from the User Manual, Wiki, and README to create the new portal. The guides will be written by coalescing only the essential bits of information. The new content would be brief for the beginner user and engaging to the veteran. | Features will not be seen zoned anymore. Certain features are of necessity to the user but are prone to be overlooked. The new documentation portal will showcase all the functionalities of ScummVM. | No repetitions. All relevant content should be in one spot. A complete compilation of all the resources in one portal. No more dispersion of data. | . | Better support . | Refreshing the manuals. The current manual is good but has become outdated. Individual sections of documentation need prime focus, such as: Running options, Configuration. These documents need to be dusted and filtered off of the unnecessary. | Scattered help. ScummVM has documented specific commonly faced issues, but again, they are all over the place. For instance: FAQs exist on every document portal. They need to be compiled and shown in one spot, preferably with tags. | . | Brand new layout . | I have compiled the entire sitemap of the new documentation portal. This will highlight all the significant changes between the existing user manual and my portal. Relocation of information is vital and one of the primary goals would be to keep resources where they should be. | Divided section “Using ScummVM” into 2 parts - “ScummVM Running Options” and “_Game Running Options”. This was done to improve readability and achieving the objective of assembling resources. | “ScummVM Running Options” focuses on the application and all related functions. | “Game Running Options” focuses on games, their issues, and related functions. | Added new sections: . | “Guides”: Features of ScummVM that every beginner and intermediate user would be interested in. (Command line options, Installation guides etc. ). This section gives prime focus towards hands-on knowledge about ScummVM. Users will find it extremely helpful | “Advanced Guides”: Features of ScummVM that only the experts use. (Compiling binaries, Music and Sound etc.) | . | Removed section “ScummVM Interface”. | . | .
