Global Main Menu deserves a bit of attention, should have a section on the quick start guide. | Redundancy can be a good thing sometimes. For instance, save files deserves a spot on “Guides” and also on “Game Options” . | Division of resources is very important and I feel this will be achieved in an incremental process with active feedback from users and developers alike. The original sitemap remains, certain pages would be given a bit of liquidity. | HOW-TOs: where should I put them? Are they guides? Or should a new section be dedicated for them? . | Compiling from sources: Unsure.

Several compilers, including GCC, mingw and recent versions of Microsoft Visual C++ are supported. If you wish to use MP3-compressed CD tracks or .SOU files, you will need to install the MAD library; likewise you will need the appropriate libraries for Ogg Vorbis and FLAC compressed sound. For compressed save states, zlib is required. Some parts of ScummVM, particularly scalers, have highly optimized versions written in assembler. If you wish to use this option, you will need to install nasm assembler. Note that we currently only have x86 MMX optimized versions, and they will not compile on other processors.

Information is plentiful but lacks a touch of professionalism. The approach will focus heavily on collecting, reconstructing, and organizing. The proposal first discusses the shortcomings of the documentation and how to tackle it. Further, it presents sitemaps, layouts, and write-up snippets to provide a sneak-peek to the new documentation portal. The user readability has been given paramount importance by using a friendly, yet informative attitude. Analysis . ScummVM’s documentation has a variety of issues. Discussed as below: . | Readability . | Information is scattered and dissipated - Information is dispersed among multiple sources of documentation. This makes the reader go through a lot of hassle trying to find instructions. | . | Navigation . | Poor documentation structure. Information is abundant but lacks a concrete catalog. What good is the gold that cannot be mined? | . | Redundancy . | Multiple instances exist for the same documentation. This leads to confusion among users, and they might feel lost trying to figure what’s best for them. | . | Highlighting . | ScummVM documentation has a plethora of amazing functionalities that never make it to the reader’s eyes.

The steps required for that differ between the various operating systems. ScummVM recommends most users to download the pre-built binaries. Refer below for the OS you want to run ScummVM on. Amiga OS4 . - Download the AmigaOS4 package from the downloads page. You will download a packed archive (.lha). - To unpack the archive, double click on it, and UnArc will either unpack right away or ask for the installation path. - Once it is unpacked, you can move the whole drawer wherever you wish to store it. Atari . TODO . BeOS . TODO . Debian . If you have the latest stable version of Debian then: . - From the [httpss://www.scummvm.org/downloads/ downloads page], download the Debian (.deb) package. - To install it, you need to be root and type dpkg -i packagename.deb into a virtual terminal near you. If you are running Debian testing or unstable then: . - The latest version of ScummVM should already be available in the repositories - To install it, type apt-get install scummvm into a virtual terminal near you. - If it still is not the latest version, then go bug the Debian package maintainer (see [[Developers Bios]) about it. To launch the GUI application, simply type scummvm in your terminal. Dreamcast . - From the downloads page, download either the Dreamcast .tar.bz2 file or the Nero image file. If you download the .tar.bz2 file: . - Use any archiver program (for eg. WinZip) to open it. - After opening the archive, copy it to the folder where you want to put it. If you download the Nero image file: . - It can be burned automatically to a CD using Nero Burning ROM or any other program that accepts NRG formatted disc images. Fedora Core / Red Hat . TODO . GP2X / GP2XWiz . TODO . iPhone .

To run ScummVM on your DS you will need an unofficial card reader. Once you have one working: . - Download the ScummVM package for Nintendo DS from the [httsp://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#stable download page]. You will download a (.zip) file - Unzip the file using any archiver program (for eg. WinZip). - Copy the files on your MicroSD card using your PC card reader. To decrease the memory usage ScummVM for Nintendo DS has been split into several builds. Depending on the game you want to play you will have to select the correct build. Even so, some of the games cannot be run on a Nintendo DS because they require too much memory. You can find the list of supported games and which build you need to use for each one in the readme_ds.txt file present in the ScummVM Nintendo DS package.

The key points of the new documentation are summarized as follows: . | Collecting and Gathering . | Information will be gathered from the User Manual, Wiki, and README to create the new portal. The guides will be written by coalescing only the essential bits of information. The new content would be brief for the beginner user and engaging to the veteran. | Features will not be seen zoned anymore. Certain features are of necessity to the user but are prone to be overlooked. The new documentation portal will showcase all the functionalities of ScummVM. | No repetitions. All relevant content should be in one spot. A complete compilation of all the resources in one portal. No more dispersion of data. | Improved flow of information. Information has been re-written after collecting. Consistency has been maintained to reflect a feel of a course. | . | Better support . | Refreshing the manuals. The current manual is good but has become outdated. Individual sections of documentation need prime focus, such as: Running options, Configuration. These documents need to be dusted and filtered off of the unnecessary. | Scattered help. ScummVM has documented specific commonly faced issues, but again, they are all over the place. For instance: FAQs exist on every document portal. They need to be compiled and shown in one spot, preferably with tags. | . | Brand new layout . | I have compiled the entire sitemap of the new documentation portal. This will highlight all the significant changes between the existing user manual and my portal. Relocation of information is vital and one of the primary goals would be to keep resources where they should be. | Divided section “Using ScummVM” into 2 parts - “ScummVM Running Options” and “_Game Running Options”. This was done to improve readability and achieving the objective of assembling resources. | “ScummVM Running Options” focuses on the application and all related functions. | “Game Running Options” focuses on games, their issues, and related functions. | Added new sections: . | “Guides”: Features of ScummVM that every beginner and intermediate user would be interested in. (Command line options, Installation guides etc. ). This section gives prime focus towards hands-on knowledge about ScummVM.
