### Peek into the future



_No words acts_

This portal portrays what was proposed. Feel free to browse through the site, and understand the skeleton of the new documentation. Certain pages consist of write-up snippets. This portal attempted to capture the essence of ScummVM and present it to the user. The pages lack content, but not spirit.
