### Peek into the future



_No words acts_

This portal portrays what was proposed. Feel free to browse through the site, and understand the skeleton of the new documentation. Certain pages consist of write-up snippets. This portal attempted to capture the essence of ScummVM and present it to the user. The pages lack content, but not spirit.

#### **Breakdown of proposed portal**

- Quick Start: Contains all information for kick-starting ScummVM. Holds instructions for Prerequisties, Installation and Interface.
- ScummVM Configuration: Launcher configuration, Command-Line,Config file, and advanced settings for Music, Graphics and Render Modes.
- Game Configuration: Custom settings for games. 
- Controls & Language: Features of ScummVM that facilitate the user experience.
- Installing Games: Since ScummVM has a vast arena of users using various ports, I believe devoting an entire section to game installation is important. There is a lot of granular information about games and ports that a user would need to know before they are able to install games.]
- Supported Games: Consolidation of ReadME into the portal.
- Guides: Probably the most important aspect missing in the current documentation. Users need some information handy when using ScummVM. This section will provide quick hands-on information on topics that are frequently used and also deserve more attention.
- Game Notes: Consolidation of ReadME into the portal.
- Troubleshooting: Issues that the user will come across. This section will hold solutions to known problems.
- Getting Help: To keep track of issues and bugs, changelogs and related content.
